# Week#1 Problem Set - Arrays

Welcome to LeetCamp Week#1! Here is this week's problem set:

**Required:**

`2 Sum:` This is a very foundational problem, and I have gotten this problem (and its variations) twice in interviews! https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

`Search Insert Position:` Try implementing both the brute-force and efficient method, and then analyze each method's time complexity: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/

**Challenge:**

`Toeplitz Matrix:` For me, the trickiest part of this problem was just figuring otu a solution! Once you have it down, the coding is very fairly straightforward: https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/description/
