# Week#1 Problem Set - Strings!

Welcome to LeetCamp Week#2! Here is this week's problem set:

**Required:**

`Implement strStr():` This is a very foundational substring problem everyone should know how to implement. Seems simple, but implementation can be a little tricky. Try drawing out all test cases if you get stuck. https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/

`Ransom Note:` This is a fun problem to solve. (Hint: If you get stuck, look up maps!)

**Challenge:**

`Group Anagrams:` Another fun problem to solve! And think about. (Hint: what do all anagrams have in common? Then group them together accordingly)
